The following sections will go over the important topic of Governance and Voting and end with a list of useful links to help with your experience of being a $Pac Masternode investor.


# Proposal Governance and Voting


One of the great features of $Pac (and other Dash based forks) is that it functions as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO for short. This mechanism allows the community to submit proposals for funding through "super blocks" which are created on the $Pac block chain. These proposals are voted on by **You** the $Pac MN owner, and each MN that you own receives one vote. Indeed, this is one of the most enabling and empowering features of owning a $Pac Masternode. It is also a responsibility that each of us has to register our votes so that the right proposals are voted through and funded. More details as well as a listing of current proposals can be found on the new [PacLyfe Governance Portal](https://www.paclyfe.net/governance){:target="_blank"}:

<br/>

<img src="{% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/images/gov1.png" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 100%;"/>

<br/>

Clicking on the proposal will show you details on the current vote counts, history, a link to the  proposal details, as well as **the voting string** needed to register your MN's votes onto the network:

<br/>

<img src="{% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/images/gov2.png" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 100%;"/>

<br/>

To vote on a proposal, click on the desired button (Yes, No, Abstain) which will copy the string needed into your clipboard. Go to your desktop wallet's menu: Tools -> Debug console, and paste the entire string as shown below:

<br/>

<img src="{% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/images/mngov3.png" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 100%;"/>

<br/>

If you want to vote **Yes** for the proposal, leave the string as is. If you want to vote **No**, then simply change the 'yes' to a 'no'. Hit enter and you should see your vote registered on the network as shown below:

<br/>

<img src="{% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/images/mngov4.png" style="display: block;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;width: 100%;"/>

<br/>

That's it! How cool is that? Not only do you have a $Pac Masternode invested with a great ROI, your MN is also providing valuable services to the $Pac network making your investment even better, and now you are voting as a part of the $Pac Governance Community of MN investors!
