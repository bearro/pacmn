<h1>
PacLyfe is live! 
</h1>

Registering is simple at [https://www.paclyfe.net/](https://www.paclyfe.net/){:target="_blank"}. 

A great features of PacLyfe is its social groups (shown above) such as the [$Pac Masternodes Investors Group](https://www.paclyfe.net/groups/pac-masternode-investors/){:target="_blank"}. Head on over if you haven't already. This will be a great place to share knowledge around shared interests. If you have any questions, post them over there so that we as a community can help each other.

One of the greatest things about $Pac is its community! And what a fantastic start to cast a wider net for those that are, as of yet, unfamilar with $Pac.

The PacLyfe portal is also a great place for participating in the [Governance Process]({% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.doks.baseurl }}{% endif %}/next-steps). 

I'm really psyched about the initial launch as the core team and devs will continue to add features. Its a great start! And a great platform to build upon.
