I just pulled this from [Masternodes Online](https://masternodes.online/){:target="_blank"}. 

$Pac is strong, both in its network and ROI. It's entry point for MN investing is also the most attractive given these factors. What a long way we've come in a few short months. Masternodes are a great way to generate passive income and it is a win-win for the investor as well as the network. $Pac MNs are in my opinion, the strongest of the bunch, with relatively low entry points, a super strong ROI as well as a great community that is second to none. Couple this with the amount of circulating coins that are locked in the Masternodes (currently **_53%_** ) and you have a great combination for increasing the value of your investment.

The general way to calculate the Return on Investment (ROI) for your $Pac Masternode is given by the following formula: `ROI = [(N / T) * R * B * A * 365] / 500000` where:
* N = The total number of masternodes owned
* T = The total number of **Active (Enabled)** masternodes on the network
* R = The current block reward (13800) 
* B = Block average in a day (576)
* A = The average masternode payment (10350)

As an example, if you own 3 $Pac MNs, we can calculate your current ROI (as of this writing) as:

`ROI = ([3 * 5094 )] * 13,800 * 576 * 10,350] / 500,000' which equals ~97% ROI in one calendar year.

This is in terms of $Pac, of course, which means that your fiat/usd ROI will be determined by your entry level into the price of the 500K $Pac collateralized as well as the current price of $Pac.
