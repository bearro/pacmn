Congratulations! You've just installed and started your new $Pac Masternode! 

A quick reminder of where we are below:

<b>Steps to create your Master Node</b>

- [x] &nbsp; ~~1. Getting Ready~~
- [x] &nbsp; ~~2. Configure your desktop wallet~~
- [x] &nbsp; ~~. Install Master Node server on your VPS~~
- [x] &nbsp; ~~4. Start your Master Node~~
- [ ] &nbsp; <mark>5. Monitor your Master Node and collect rewards</mark>


<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p>
    Your desktop/cold wallet synchronizes with the $Pac network and its distributed blockchain whenever it is online and connected. Your $Pac Masternode must stay online and connected all of the time in order to provide second tier services to the network. What this means is that you can shut down your desktop/cold wallet for as long as you like, as long as your $Pac MN on your vps is running. This is where monitoring becomes handy and important.
